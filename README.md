## Summary
I am a beginner Frontend developer. Every day I develop my own projects or improve my current knowledge and skills, study new features of the language. I think that I am ready for commercial development because I am confident in my skills. Anything I don't know, I can easily find and study on my own or ask my colleagues politely and competently. I am able to work in a team.
